## Download

The MoPub SDK is distributed as source code that you can include in your application.  MoPub provides two prepackaged archives of source code:

- **[MoPub Android Full SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdU9v)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML and MRAID MoPub advertisiments *and* built-in support for two major third party ad networks - [Google AdMob](http://www.google.com/ads/admob/) and [Millennial Media](http://www.millennialmedia.com/) - including the required third party binaries.

- **[MoPub Android Base SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdWhH)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML and MRAID MoPub advertisements.  No third party ad networks are included.

## Integrate

Integration instructions are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started).


## New in this Version

Please view the [changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

  - **Native ads mediation** release; integration instructions and documentation are available on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/wiki/Integrating-Native-Third-Party-Ad-Networks). Added custom event native implementations to the native extras directory of the SDK (`/extras/src/com/mopub/nativeads`), with initial support for the following networks:
  	- Facebook Audience Network (`FacebookNative.java`)
  	- InMobi Native Ads (`InMobiNative.java`)
  - **Native ads content filtering**: Added the ability to specify which native ad elements you want to receive from the MoPub Marketplace to optimize bandwidth use and download only required assets, via `RequestParameters.Builder#desiredAssets(â€¦)`. This feature only works for the six standard Marketplace assets, found in `RequestParameters.NativeAdAsset`. Any additional elements added in direct sold ads will always be sent down in the extras.
  - Added star rating information to the `NativeResponse` object, via `NativeResponse#getStarRating()`. This method returns a `Double` corresponding to an app's rating on a 5-star scale.
  - Bug fixes

## Requirements
