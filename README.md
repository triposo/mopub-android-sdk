- **[MoPub Android Base SDK.zip](http://bit.ly/YUdWhH)**

  Includes everything you need to serve HTML and MRAID MoPub advertisements.  No third party ad networks are included.

## New in this Version

Please view the [changelog](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

  - **MRAID 2.0 Support** - The MoPub SDK is now compliant with the MRAID 2.0 specification to enable rich media ads in banners and interstitial ad units. Learn more about MRAID from the [IAB](http://www.iab.net/MRAID#MRAID).
  - **Location Polling Updates** - Changed the interaction between application- and device-provided location data: more recent location data is now always used (in the past, application-provided location data was always preferred).
    
    As before, you may still disable MoPub SDK's location polling by calling `MoPub.setLocationAwareness(LocationAwareness.DISABLED)`.
  - **Updated Chartboost SDK** Updated the `ChartboostInterstitial` custom event to support Chartboost SDK 5.0.4
